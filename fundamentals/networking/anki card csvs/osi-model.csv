What is the purpose of the OSI model?|To provide a standard for people developing interconnected systems.
How many layers does the OSI model have and how are they organized?|It has 7 layers, abstracted in increasing closeness to the end user (7 = closest, 1 = furthest).
What is a Protocol Data Unit (PDU) in the OSI model?|The specific name for the data format at each layer of the OSI model.
What is the layer number, PDU, and function of the Application layer?|Layer 7, PDU: Data, Function: High level protocols such as resource sharing/remote file access (e.g. HTTP, gRPC).
What is the layer number, PDU, and function of the Presentation layer?|Layer 6, PDU: Data, Function: Translation of data between a networking service and an application, including character encoding, data compression, and encryption/decryption.
What is the layer number, PDU, and function of the Session layer?|Layer 5, PDU: Data, Function: Managing communication sessions (continuous information exchange in the form of multiple back-and-forth transmissions between two nodes).
What is the layer number, PDU, and function of the Transport layer?|Layer 4, PDU: Segment/Datagram, Function: Transmission of data segments between points on a network, including segmentation, acknowledgement, and multiplexing (TCP vs UDP).
What is the layer number, PDU, and function of the Network layer?|Layer 3, PDU: Packet, Function: Structuring and managing a multi-node network, including addressing (IP), routing, and traffic control.
What is the layer number, PDU, and function of the Data Link layer?|Layer 2, PDU: Frame, Function: Transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer (e.g. Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
What is the layer number, PDU, and function of the Physical layer?|Layer 1, PDU: Bit, Function: Transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium.
